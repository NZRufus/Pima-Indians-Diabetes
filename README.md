# Pima-Indians-Diabetes
Determining risk of diabetes/ prevalence of diabetes
THis project was aiming to build a model for predicting whether a Female Pima Native American has diabetes or not. 
This was based upon various readily measurable physical factors and combining them into a supervised learning model. This model was improved by using the Ensemble method where different supervised learning models were combined to build a more accurate model.
Data came from the MCI database. The project is an observational one to show mainly that Ensemble method can be effective for improving models as well as how to clean data to some degree as well as how to interpret results and how to potentially change specifications to meet certain needs such as accuracy cf precision and whether interested in avoiding false positives or false negatives. 
THe methodology was mainly self-taught using a variety of Datacamp and Udemy methods for Python (Data Cleaning/wrangling/Pandas/Seaborn), Supervised Learning and Ensemble Method.
