# Pima-Indians-Diabetes
**Aims and Objectives - Determining risk of diabetes/ prevalence of diabetes in Pima Native Americans**

This project was aiming to build a model for predicting whether a Female Pima Native American has diabetes or not. This project was chosen as I am interested in supervised learning and one of the areas of work that I am interested in working in the future is Health Research and potentially Epidemiology.

**Libraries Used**
The main libraries used were Python, Numpy and Pandas for data processing/cleaning, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualisation and Scikit-Learn for supervised Learning. 
This was based upon various readily measurable physical factors and combining them into a supervised learning model. This model was improved by using the Ensemble method where different supervised learning models were combined to build a more accurate model.

**Data Sources**

Thanks to the UCI database repository where the data was obtained. It was the Pima Indians file that had 768 subjects measured across 8 predicter variables and 1 outcome variable (whether have diabetes or not).

**Methods Used and Questions Asked**

The project is an observational one to show mainly that 1) An Ensemble method can be built to predict diabetes outcome in Female Pima Native Americans with reasonable good accuracy/precision. 2) Separate Supervised Learning techniques could be used as well that were better than baseline but not as good as the Ensemble Method 3) How to clean the  data to some degree as well as 4) how to interpret results and how to potentially change specifications to meet certain needs such as accuracy cf precision and whether interested in avoiding false positives or false negatives.

The methodology was mainly self-taught using a variety of Datacamp and Udemy methods for Python (Data Cleaning/wrangling/Pandas/Seaborn), Supervised Learning and Ensemble Method.
